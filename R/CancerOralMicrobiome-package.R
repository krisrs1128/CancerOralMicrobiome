#' These data can be use to reproduce the results in the paper, "Oral microbial
#' signatures of head and neck cancer patients with diverse longitudinal oral
#' mucositis severity patterns," which analyzes a data set originally generated in
#' "Influence of oral microbiome on longitudinal patterns of oral mucositis
#' severity in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck." Code
#' to reproduce the examples can be found at the OMScoreAnalysis repository on
#' Github: https://github.com/SarithaKodikara/OMScoreAnalysis. The RDS object
#' zhang2023-ps.rds is a phyloseq object that combines all other microbiome and
#' sample information. It is the main export of this package.
